## Quick Start Guide

The following guide allows you to check and monitor the progress of setting up your icarus unit.

1. Remove ratchet straps and the L-brackets from the bottom of the
printer that attach it to the crate. Adjust the casters, so the wheels are
on the pallet.
2. Remove the machine from the pallet by gently rolling it off and move
the machine to the general area where it will be used.
3. Remove the shrink wrap from the machine and open the main door.
Inside the printer, please remove your included CW-3000 water chiller,
filament and any other boxes you see.
4. From the back of the printer, connect the two water lines to the back
of the chiller, it does not matter what hose goes into what port. Pour
roughly 1.75 gallons of blue windshield washer fluid into the chiller (fluid
not supplied). Plug the CW-3000 water chiller into the back of the
printer with the power switch on. The chiller turns on with the printer.
5. Plug the 110VAC cord into the wall which is located on the rear right of
the unit, twist the red emergency stop clockwise to disengage it, and
flip the red toggle switch. The unit should now be powered on and you
will hear a series of beeps when the chiller turns on. If you do not hear
these beeps, please be sure the chiller switch is on and plugged in.
6. From the touch screen, temporarily disable to WiFi by pressing:
Console > Keyboard Icon > Type “M552 S0” > Enter
Note: This step is not relevant if you have the CAT5/6 version.
7. From the touch screen, select and run the following macro by pressing
the Macro button:
Macro > “Bed Leveling” > “Mesh Bed Leveling - RT”
8. Connect to a Wifi Network (page 21). Check that you can connect to
the Duet Web Control interface afterward (detailed in this manual).
Install the webcam, if desired, following the instructions from the Wyze
Cam app on your phone or tablet.
9. Install the slicer profiles from the website and – HAPPY PRINTING
